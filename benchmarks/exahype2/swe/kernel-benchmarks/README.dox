@page benchmarks_exahype2_swe_kernel_benchmarks Benchmarks of Compute Kernels for the Shallow Water Equations

We provide example plots of outputs obtained from Leonardo.

The benchmarks were run with a SWE setup using 2048 patches per kernel launch,
32 compute threads, 1 launching thread and 16 finite volumes per axis.
The maximal eigenvalue has been evaluated and we took 10 measurements samples.

The following Python command was used:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    python3 kernel-benchmarks.py --patch-size 16 --num-patches 2048 --samples 10 --eval-eig
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We show the best case throughputs.
