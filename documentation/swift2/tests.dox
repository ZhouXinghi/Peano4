Swift comes along with a set of test programs.
These can be found under `/tests/swift2/`
and should all run out-of-the-box via the provided `run.sh` scripts.
Before you start, ensure that you have configured and built Peano as specified
for @ref section_compile_peano4_for_swift2 "Swift".
Notice that some of these will use HDF5 files and hence require the correponding
configuration for Peano. See @ref section_compile_peano4_for_swift2.

The tests located in `tests/swift2/hydro-simple-sph-physics` are intended to
verify that the physics solvers are correct on classic problems. They are
well-suited to use as first examples to get familiar with Swift2.
