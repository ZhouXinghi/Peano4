    Update cell in primary sweep

    This action set is used in the primary sweeps only. In the secondary sweep,
    its counterpart, the action set MergeEnclaveTaskOutcome, is active and works in all data
    computed by tasks which have been spawned here.

    We extend the superclass ReconstructPatchAndApplyFunctor and hence have
    access to the reconstructed data including a halo layer of one. Furthermore,
    the superclass provides us with a guard which we should use, as this guard
    ensures that we reconstruct the patch plus halo if and only if certain
    conditions are met. By default, we compute only on unrefined octants.

    Our condition whether to spawn a task or to compute the new time step
    data immediately depends on peano4::datamanagement::CellMarker::willBeSkeletonCell().
    If this predicate holds, we compute stuff straightaway. Otherwise, we
    span a new enclave task. While this check does the job in almost all
    cases, there are special situations where you might want to label more
    cells as skeleton cells.


    ## Modify templates

    You can alter the template. Typical codes augment _Template_TouchCellFirstTime_Preamble
    for example. However, there are two things to consider:

    - _Template_TouchCellFirstTime_Preamble is a member of the class and
      initialised in the constructor.
    - The constructor is used to create an object in the create_action_sets()
      of the using class.

    If you want to alter the preamble, you thus should specialise
    create_action_sets() and invoke the supertype's create_action_sets(). After
    that, alter self._action_set_update_cell._Template_TouchCellFirstTime_Preamble.
    We recommend to add an entry and not to replace the preamble, as the
    preamble already consists meaningful code.

    Enclave tasking variant of the Finite Volume scheme

    The concept of (enclave) tasking within ExaHyPE solvers is described in
    detail in the @ref page_exahype_solvers_enclave_solvers "generic enclave discussion of ExaHyPE".
    This class is a prototype realisation of this concept which other solvers
    then specialise for particular numerical schemes.

    The class basically replaces the standard "update a cell" action set with an
    action set that might or might not spawn a task. In return, it adds a further
    action set which merges the arising task outcomes into the actual mesh
    structure. By default, we use peano4::datamanagement::CellMarker::willBeEnclaveCell()
    and peano4::datamanagement::CellMarker::hasBeenEnclaveCell() to guide the
    decision whether to spawn a task or not. You can overwrite this decision
    by redefining the corresponding entry in the dictionary befilled by
    add_entries_to_text_replacement_dictionary().


    ## Task priorities

    Use the attributes self.enclave_task_priority to change the priority of the
    task. This value can either be a string that C++ can evaluate into a
    priority or a plain numerical value. I set it to

           self.enclave_task_priority  = "tarch::multicore::Task::DefaultPriority-1"

        Make storage and loading more restrictive such that enclave data are not held in-between primary and secondary sweep

        If you work with global time stepping, you know that each enclave cell will
        be updated per grid traversal duo. Consequently, every enclave cell's data
        doesn't have to be stored in-between two grid traversals - we know that it
        is currently outsourced to a task.

        Things are different if we use local time stepping, as there will always be
        cells that are currently processed, and then there are cells which are not
        updated and which we consequently should keep.

        If you want to have this optimisation, you have to call this routine
        explicitly in create_data_structures(). By default, we always store the
        patches all the time.
        
        If we work with smart pointers, it is a bad idea to call this routine,
        as the enclave framework does not(!) use smart pointers. So we rely on 
        the fact that someone holds the raw pointers alive. If we don't store 
        data here, we run risk that the smart pointer becomes zero and the 
        underlying memory is freed while the enclave task still works against it.
        
        As I don't know what storage scheme we employ, I decided to disable 
        this routine. Notably as I don't think storing makes much of a 
        difference if data are held on the heap anyway.

        Adaptive mesh handing

        Adaptive meshes require us to clear the patch overlaps and to restrict/interpolate.
        Obviously, there's no need to do this for a refined faces. So we can eliminate these
        cases a priori. Furthermore, we clear faces only in the primary sweep. We know that
        either the primary sweep (for skeleton) or the secondary sweep (for enclaves) will
        write in proper data into anything that's cleared, and we know that restriction only
        has to happen after the primary sweep, as all cells next to an adaptivity boundary
        are skeleton cells.

        As pointed out, both interpolation and restriction are to be active for the first
        sweep only. We interpolate into hanging faces, and we have to restrict immediately
        again as they are non-persistent. The projection onto the (hanging) faces is also
        happening directly in the primary sweep, as the cells adjacent to the hanging
        face are skeleton cells.

        AMR and adjust cell have to be there always, i.e., also throughout
        the grid construction. But the criterion is something that we only
        evaluate in the secondary sweep. That's when we have an updated/changed time step.
        If we identify coarsening and refinement instructions in the secondary sweep, the
        next primary one will actually see them and trigger the update. That is, the
        subsequent secondary switch will actually implement the grid changes, and we can
        evaluate the criteria again.

        For dynamic AMR, this implies that we have to ensure that all changed grid parts
        are labelled as skeleton cells. This way, we can implement the AMR properly, we
        ensure that all the enclaves run in parallel, and we know that all data is held
        persistently on the stacks.
