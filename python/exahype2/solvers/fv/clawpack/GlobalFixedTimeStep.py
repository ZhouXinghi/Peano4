class GlobalFixedTimeStep( SingleSweep ):
  """
  
  This is the simplest ClawPack-based solver one could think about. The
  minimal requirement to implement a SingleSweep (or enclave) solver
  is to inherit from the base class and set the Riemann solver to be 
  used and the right-hand side (source term).
  
  Furthermore, we have to say how to determine the admissible time 
  step size, and we have to augment the dictionary with entries that 
  are ClawPack-specific.
  

  ==========
  Attributes
  ==========
  
  There are two particularly important flags: 
  
  clawpack_name: String
    This is the name of the actual ClawPack solver name. We simply
    store it in a local attribute. Once we build up our dictionary
    in add_entries_to_text_replacement_dictionary(), we map this 
    local attribute onto an entry in the dict and then can use it 
    within our templates.
  
  discriminate_normal: Boolean
    This is a flag which switches between two ways how the ClawPack
    solvers are called.
    
  clawpack_files: [String]
    List of Fortran files. Will be forwarded to   
    add_implementation_files_to_project(). You can always leave this 
    one empty and add files later on.
    

  ================
  Invocation order
  ================
  
  We call the superclass constructor which will establish all the finite volume
  data structures et al. See the documentation of the superclass or FV.
  
  The FV setup will automatically invoke add_entries_to_text_replacement_dictionary()
  at multiple points to translate some templates into meaningful (default) 
  C++ code. Obviously, you can always alter setups later on by altering
  the object state. In this case, you will have to regenerate all data
  structures. 
  
  Our ClawPack-specific dictionary entries have to know what the name of 
  the chosen ClawPack routine is and whether or not we use
