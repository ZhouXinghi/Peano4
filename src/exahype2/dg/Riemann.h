/**
 * @page exahype2_dg_DG_AMD Discontinuous Galerkin adaptive mesh refinement
 *
 * The AMR management is distributed among two files: The present header file
 * hosts a couple of routines which realise the steps required for AMR. We
 * write what and how things are done in C++. The routines pair up with the
 * Python file exahype2.solvers.rkdg.actionsets.DynamicAMR. This Python file
 * orchestrates the AMR operations, i.e. it decided when things are done. Most
 * of the docu for the whole AMR business is however collected here.
 *
 * AMR for DG is basically a Riemann problem and can be illustrated in 1d.
 * Let there be two levels called coarse and fine as illustrated below:
 *
 * @image html adaptive-mesh-refinement.png
 *
 * Every face holds the polynomial value left and right of it. So the green
 * face (it is a vertex here as we illustrate things in 1d, but it is really
 * a face) holds the left solution after each initial step of the Runge Kutta
 * scheme. A face is unique through its position and its level. So there are
 * two faces at the same location: the green one and the red one.
 *
 *
 * ## Rationale and alternatives
 *
 * Here's some terminology:
 * - A cell is refined if one of its adjacent vertices holds a refinement
 *   flag. This is called or-based refinement.
 * - A face therefore is called a refined face if one of its adjacent
 *   vertices holds the refinement flag.
 * - A hanging vertex is a vertex with less than 2^d adjacent cells on the
 *   same level. All other vertices are persistent.
 * - A hanging face is a face where no vertex is persistent, i.e. all
 *   adjacent vertices are hanging.
 * - Non-persistent data is not hold in-between two grid traversals.
 *
 * To solve the Riemann problem, we have three options:
 *
 * - We could project the coarse solution downwards, solve the Riemann
 *   problem there, and thus have a valid solution for F. In return, we
 *   could project the fine grid solutions also up into the green face,
 *   solve the Riemann problem there, and update C with the outcome.
 * - We could project the coarse solution down, solve the Riemann
 *   problem there, and restrict the solution up into the green face.
 *   No Riemann problem is solved there, but we use the restricted
 *   solutions of the fine grid Riemann problems.
 * - We restrict the solutions from the fine grid cell F into the right
 *   side of the green face and solve the Rieman problem in the green
 *   face. Then, we project the solution down to the hanging face. No
 *   Riemann problem is solved on the fine grid.
 *
 * Once we benchmark these three options against our terminology, it
 * becomes clear that only the third variant is an option. We need the
 * left and right solution and this works only if face data are
 * persistent.
 *
 * We project every cell. So the projected polynomial arrives on every
 * face, also the hanging one.
 *
 *
 * ## Algorithm
 *
 * - In the primary grid sweep where we project onto the face (and
 *   maybe solve the volume):
 *   - Clear the solution every non-refined face, so there are zeroes
 *     in there.
 *   - Project solution onto face (this is done via the action set
 *     ProjectLinearCombinationOfEstimates anyway).
 *   - If we encounter the destruction of a hanging face, restrict
 *     the projected solution. This can be done via an accummulation.
 *     We have cleared the solution before to zero.
 * - In the secondary grid sweep where we solve the Riemann problem
 *   and bring the solutions together:
 *   - Solve the Riemann problem on the coarser face (is done anyway
 *     by action set SolveRiemannProblem).
 *   - Project the solution down onto the hanging face when it is
 *     created.
 *   - Update the fine cell with the projected data.
 *
 * From the sketch above, we see that we don't need any sophisticated
 * case distinction.
 *
 * - Clear the face data in touchFaceFirstTime of the primary sweep.
 *   We can always do this, as the projection will overwrite it for
 *   those faces that point towards a fine grid cell.
 * - Always restrict/accummulate the solution if a hanging face is
 *   destroyed. We rely on a top-down tree traversal, so we know that
 *   any coarser face is already handled, even if we restrict and
 *   thus accummulate twice.
 * - Always interpolate the Riemann solution.

     * ## Interpolation matrix
     *
     * Core ingredient to this routine is the interpolation matrix.
     * I describes how to interpolate a 1d polynomial over the unit
     * interval into the three subcell polynomials. Consequently,
     * the matrix points to three matrices. One for the left, one
     * for the middle, one for the right subcell.
     *
     * Each matrix accepts the order+1 values at the quadrature points
     * as input, i.e. each matrix has order+1 columns. Each matrix
     * returns the the output for one quadrature point at the chosen
     * subcell. So each matrix has order+1 rows.
     *
     * In the example above, we work with polynomials of order three.
     * We hence have four quadrature points.
     *
     * @image html interpolation.png
     *
     * In the example above, the weights in c1, c2, c3 and c4 span a
     * polynomial (blue). InterpolationMatrix1d points to
     * @f$ 3 \cdot 4^2 @f$ entries. If we want to know the interpolated
     * value for f31, we have to pick the third matrix (matrix index 2
     * as we start counting at zero), then take the first row of this
     * matrix, and multiply its four entries with c1, c2, c3, c4.
     *
     * All entries in all faces are enumerated lexicographically, i.e.
     * from left to right, bottom-up, and always first along the x-axis,
     * then y, then z.
     *
     *
     * ## Implementation
     *
     * I first construct a
     * face enumerator. So I don't really have to care about the serialisation
     * of the dofs anymore. This is all done by the enumerator.
     *
     * Next, I compute the total number of unknowns (doubles) in the fine grid
     * face and set them all to zero. From now on, I can accumulate the result.
     * There is a factor of 2 in the calculation of the total number of unknowns.
     * It results from the fact that I have a left and a right projection.
     *
     * The main part of the routine is a nested loop, where I run over all
     * combinations of input and output dofs. Again, these are three loops
     * nested, as I always have left and right.
     *
     * Per combination, I have to compute the d-1-dimensional tensor product
     * over the interpolation matrix. For 2d, this degenerates to a simple
     * lookup.
     *
     *
     * ## Evaluation of interpolation/restriction matrix
     *
     * We run over the d-1-dimensional dofs of both coarse and fine grid face.
     * For a 2d simulation, we hence run over a one-dimensional thing. The
     * interpolation and restriction matrices in ExaHyPE are written down as
     * 1d operators, as any dimension then results from a tensor-product
     * approach.
     *
     * So in 2d, we can only count which index in the coarse and fine grid
     * face we are currently handling and thus effectively run through the
     * interpolation matrix row by row and column by column. In 3d, where
     * the face is actually a 2d object, this does not work. Here, the row
     * and column indices are defined by the entry along one direction and
     * d-1 entries have to be multiplied (tensor product). So effectively,
     * we have to map the dof counter for coarse and fine first to the
     * indices of a 1d projection operator.
     *
     *
     * @param numberOfProjectedQuantities This is one if we only project the
     *   solution. It is two if we project the solution and the F-value or
     *   the solution and itsgradient along the normal.

     * The restriction matrix has exactly the same form as the interpolation

     * of RestrictionMatrix1d, compute the c1, c2, c3 and c4 values and then
     * add them to the coarse representation. The interpolation can overwrite.
     *
     * Different to the interpolation, we only restrict one half of the face
     * and not both. The interpolation can set both sides, as it overwrites
     * a hanging face (or a new one). When we restrict, we know that a
     * persistent coarse grid face might already hold some projected solution.
     * We are interested in the other half. If we accumulate both, we'd add
     * the interpolated value (or any other rubbish) again to the one face
     * part which had been valid before.
     *
     *
     * ## Differences to interpolateRiemannSolution()
     *
     * - In the final accummulation, we write to the coarse grid while the
     *   interpolation writes to the fine grid. Consequently, coarse grid
     *   and fine grid data are permuted in the signature.
     * - The restriction works on the solution that is extrapolated to the
     *   faces. Consequently, these data hold auxiliary variables. The
     *   Riemann solution instead does not hold any auxiliary variables.
     * - The restriction does not clear the target field, i.e. write zeros
     *   to it. That has to be done earlier by the mesh traversal, as
     *   multiple restriction calls accummulate in one variable, i.e. if
     *   we clear we loose all the data from previous restrictions.
     * - Row and column indices are permuted in the matrix access, i.e. the
     *   coarse grid dof determines the target (image) and hence defines the
     *   row.
