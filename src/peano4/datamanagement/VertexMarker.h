/**
 * Vertex marker to provide information about selected vertex
 *
 * A vertex marker is handed into each and every observer/action set routine
 * which is vertex-based. That is routines such as touchVertexFirstTime().
 * The marker provides information about the underlying vertex.
 *
 * Notably, we can provide
 *
 * - geometric information such as the position of a vertex or the size of
 *   the adjacent cells.
 * - status information such as whether a vertex is hanging.
 * - grid layout information such as the vertex's position within the
 *   parent cell.
 *
 * ## Rationale
 *
 * Peano's events (observer and action set routines) are internally all
 * implemented on a per cell basis. So we invoke touchVertexFirstTime()
 * from the cell when the first adjacent cell of a vertex is entered.
 * Therefore, we know the selected vertex.
 *
 * Peano runs through the mesh with a tree automaton. A lot of information
 * about vertices thus is recomputed on-the-fly all the time, as it is easy
 * to derive it from the context. We know, for example, from the state of the
 * traversal automaton if a vertex is hanging or not or which position in
 * space it has. Therefore, such information is not stored within the vertex
 * (unless for debugging purposes). Not only would the information be redundant,
 * it would also be very inefficient: If you work with k data records per
 * vertex, each one would hold the same information about the underlying
 * vertex's position. So it makes more sense to encode such information with
 * a separate object.
 *
 * @see FaceMarker for the analogous information for faces.
