/**
 * Command Line Logger
 *
 * Standard log output device. Implements the LogHandle. Usually there's only
 * one instance of this class for only the Log type aggregates it in a static
 * way. For a detailed description of this compiler flags please browse through
 * the static consts of the class or the howto page.
 *
 * An interesting issue is the behaviour of the command line logger in the
 * parallel mode if debug is switched on. In this case the number of messages
 * soon becomes unreadable for any human. Thus, the command line logger
 * internally creates one output file rank.log for each rank and writes all the
 * information into this file. info, warnings and errors are written (in short form)
 * to std::cout / std::cerr, too.
 *
 * If the debug mode is not set, all information is written to std::cout.
 *
 * Note, that if multithreading is switched on (TBB-flag), the access to std::cout or the
 * logfile respectively is synchronized. The other methods are not thread-safe and should
 * be called only in safe context for defined behaviour.

     * Tells the logger to increment/decrement the indent.
     *
     * !!! Thread Safety
     *
     * _indent is a global static field shared by all threads. If we increment
     * or decrement it, this is first of all a read followed by a write.
     * Consequently data races could occur and the counter could become smaller
     * than zero. This ain't possible in the sequential code as each increment
     * is accompanied by a decrement. The following table illustrates the race:
     *
     * || value of _indent  || Thread 1 || Thread 2
     * |  2                 |  initial condition   |  initial condition
     * |                    |  enter indent(false) |  enter indent(true)
     * |                    |  fetch indent into register |  fetch indent into register
     * |                    |  register value -= 2 |  register value += 2
     * |  4                 |  is a little bit slower |  write back new value of indent
     * |  0                 |  write back new value of indent |
     *
     * To avoid this data race, I introduced a semaphore. This one could also
     * be implemented with TBB's atomic construct, e.g., but I prefer the
     * semaphor / critical section technique.
     *
     * @param trace    Needed in debug mode to be able to find out who called indent(false) without an indent(true)
