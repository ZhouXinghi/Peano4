/**
 * Represents one test case. Every test case should be a subclass of this
 * class implementing run(). Furthermore subtypes should use the assertion
 * macros included to check any assumption. All the test cases are managed by the
 * TestCaseCollection.
 *
 * If you implement your own tests, inherit from this class, implement
 * run() and add the test to a test case collection of your choice.
 *
 *
 * <h2> Implementation remarks </h2>
 *
 * Whenever you write a test case implementation, we recommend to add the
 * code block
 *
 * \code
#ifdef UseTestSpecificCompilerSettings
#pragma optimize("",off)
#endif
   \endcode
 * at the very beginning of your implementation and
 * \code
#ifdef UseTestSpecificCompilerSettings
#pragma optimize("",on)
#endif
   \endcode
 *
 * at the end of the implementation file.
 *
 *
 * <h2> Unit tests in libraries </h2>
 *
 * If your unit test is part of a library, then simply registering the test is
 * not enough, as the linker will remove the test again - assuming it is not
 * invoked. I therefore decided not to rely on any automatic test case suites
 * or so, but instead let the individual libraries build up their unit test
 * suites manually. See the respective headers called UnitTests.
