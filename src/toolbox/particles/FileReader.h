     * In an SPMD environment, it is convenient to make each rank maintain its
     * own input database. As a consequence, ranks have redundant particles and
     * we will have to clean up eventually. To mirror this behaviour in the
     * multithreaded context, we can remove particles whenever we assign them
     * to an inner vertex, but we should also hand them out redundantly for
     * boundary vertices.
     *
     * @param x      Center of voxel. If you use this within
     *   touchVertexFirstTime(), you can use the vertex position, i.e. the x()
     *   operation of the marker. If you use this function within a cell event,
     *   you can use x() as well, as it returns the centre.
     * @param h      Size of voxel. If you use this function within a cell
     *   event, just pass in h(). If you use it within a vertex event, you
     *   should scale h with 0.5.
     * @param remove Remove a particle form the internal database if it is a
     *   match. In most cases, removing the particles immediately speeds up
     *   things, even though we then have a lot of (uneccessary) locks.
