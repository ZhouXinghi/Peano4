 @page tests_swift2_dastgen_test DastGen2 Test


A test to generate all possible combinations of variables, ifdefs, and variable
qualifiers for data model members using DastGen2.

This test basically tests that everything DastGen2 generates compiles and runs as expected.
The test is successful if it compiles and runs. We don't solve any actual physics here.
We are also not using regular SPH particles, or anything like that, but the DastgenDummyParticle
defined in DastgenDummyParticle.py .

(For now?) you'll need to compile Peano as if you're running SWIFT2.
See @ref section_compile_peano4_for_swift2  "the instructions".


Run the program using `run.sh`
