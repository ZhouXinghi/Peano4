 @page tests_swift2_hydro_simple_sph_noh_2d Noh implosion test in 2D

 Simple Noh implosion test benchmark with @f$ N ^d @f$ particles. You specify
 the @f$ N @f$ on the command line, as well as some other arguments. The setup
 will yield snapshots similar to the ones below.

 As with all Swift 2 experiments, you have to ensure that you translate with --enable-particles --enable-swift.

 ## Experimental setup

 We allow the user to specify the number of particles per axis via the Python
 argument --particle-number (or -np). We aim for roughly 20 particles per cell,
 which is physically unreasonable, but we can do so for this test, which means
 that it is reasonable to start with a mesh size of roughly @f$ \frac{1}{np} \cdot 20 \sqrt[-1]{d} @f$.


 Below is a rough guideline (overview) of particle per axis and outcome for 2d
 experiments:

 np | initial mesh cells | mesh cells after insertion |
----|--------------------|----------------------------|
 10 |            9 (3x3) |                   81 (9x9) |
 20 |            9 (3x3) |                   81 (9x9) |
 40 |            9 (3x3) |                   81 (9x9) |
 80 |           81 (9x9) |                729 (27x27) |
160 |        729 (27x27) |              6,561 (81x81) |
320 |        729 (27x27) |              6,561 (81x81) |
640 |      6,561 (81x81) |             59,049 |


As always, the important detail is to study all artifacts that our Python API
produces. Per executable, you will obtain a README-my-exec.md file which
details your settings, provides.
