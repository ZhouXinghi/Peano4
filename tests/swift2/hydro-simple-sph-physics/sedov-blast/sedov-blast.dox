We have the option to either insert the particles by coordinates and inject the
energy via a initialisation snippet, or read an hdf5 file which sets all the ICs
for the problem.

  - The initialisation snippet provide two different ways to inject the energy to
    the central particles. 1) distribute energy evenly among the central
    particles, or 2) distribute energy smoothly among the central particles.

The initialisation snippet is very old and hence it requires some updates such
as:

@TODO the initialisation snippet:
  - Implement a good way to select how many central particles we want to use to
    inject the energy. Currently this is hard coded, but should be done, e.g.,
    based on the inter-particle separation (1/HYDRO_PART_NUMBER).

@TODO try the hdf5
@TODO if reading hdf5 file, pass the correct number of particles to the exported
Constants.h file.
