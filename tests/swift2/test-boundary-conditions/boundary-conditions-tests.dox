 @page tests_swift2_test_boundary_conditions Test boundary conditions


Very rudimentary tests to verify that the boundary conditions are working
as expected.

The periodic_[1,2,3]D tests test simple setups in [1,2,3] dimensions.
We use a generic particle type with a constant velocity and drift it
over time across periodic boundaries.

To verify the results, you can either just load the output files with
paraview and manually inspect that you're not losing particles.

Alternately, a script `compare_particle_positions.py` is provided.
It will compare the output at t=0 with the output at an end time
you provide as a cmdline argument, and check whether the particles
are in the positions they're supposed to be.
