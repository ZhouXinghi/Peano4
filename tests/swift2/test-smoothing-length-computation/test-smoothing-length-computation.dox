@page tests_swift2_test_smoothing_length_computation Smoothing Length Computation Tests

Scripts and setups to test the smoothing length computation algorithms in 1D, 2D, and 3D.
There are basically two running modes:

1) generate a new IC with randomly sampled particle positions. Then run swift2
on it and write down the output at t=0 as particles-0.vtu. Finally read that file
back in using the provided python script `compare_results.py`, compute the smoothing
lengths using python again (but in a somewhat different manner), and compare the results.

Furthermore, there are 2 types of tests you can run:

    a)  The "normal" test, following `run.sh`. This will generate a file containing
        uniformly distributed particles, which are then randomly displaced.
    b)  The "multiscale" test, following `run_multiscale.sh`. This will also generate
        a setup that encourages multiscale interactions between particles.


2) Provide the script `compare_results.py` with an already existing swift2 snapshot
(`particle-X.vtu` file). It then computes the smoothing lengths from the given
particle positions, and compares them to the smoothing lengths given in the snapshot.
